# Python - Serialization

This README provides a summary of various resources related to data serialization and parsing in Python, covering CSV to JSON conversion, XML parsing, and different serialization methods including JSON and pickle.


### Introduction:

Welcome to our exploration of marshaling and serialization, two fundamental concepts in computer science that enable the efficient storage and transmission of data. In this programming project, you will delve deep into how data can be transformed and communicated between different parts of a system, or even across different systems. This project is designed to enhance your understanding and practical skills in handling data in real-world applications.

### What is Marshaling?

Marshaling is the process of transforming memory objects into a format that can be stored or transmitted over a network. It involves packaging complex objects and their attributes into a simpler, often binary, format. This is crucial in scenarios such as remote procedure calls, where objects need to be represented in a standard format across different computing platforms.

### What is Serialization?

Serialization, closely related to marshaling, specifically involves converting data structures or object states into a format that can be easily saved to a file or sent over a network. The main goal of serialization is to preserve the state of an object, so it can be recreated in an identical state elsewhere. This becomes essential in developing applications that require data persistence, distributed computing, and data sharing between different software components.

## Resources

### 1. Convert CSV to JSON using Python
**Source**: [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/convert-csv-to-json-using-python/)

This article explains how to convert data from CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format using Python. The steps include:

- Reading a CSV file using the `csv` module.
- Converting the CSV data to a dictionary.
- Serializing the dictionary to a JSON string using the `json` module.

Key Functions:

- `csv.reader()`: Reads the CSV file.
- `json.dumps()`: Converts a Python object to a JSON string.

### 2. XML Parsing in Python using ElementTree
**Source**: [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/python-xml-elementtree)

This tutorial introduces XML parsing using Python’s `xml.etree.ElementTree` module. It covers:

- Parsing an XML file.
- Navigating and modifying the XML tree.
- Extracting data from XML elements.

Key Functions:
- `ElementTree.parse()`: Parses an XML file into an ElementTree object.
- `find()`, `findall()`: Methods to find elements within the XML tree.
- `iter()`: Iterates through elements in the tree.

### 3. Python Pickle Module
**Source**: [Python Official Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html)

The `pickle` module in Python is used for serializing and deserializing Python objects. Key points include:

- Serialization of Python objects into a byte stream.
- Deserialization of byte streams back into Python objects.
- Understanding the security risks associated with loading pickled data from untrusted sources.

Key Functions:

- `pickle.dump()`: Serializes an object and writes it to a file.
- `pickle.load()`: Deserializes an object from a file.
- `pickle.dumps()`: Serializes an object to a byte stream.
- `pickle.loads()`: Deserializes an object from a byte stream.

### 4. Working with JSON in Python
**Source**: [Real Python](https://realpython.com/python-json/)

This tutorial provides a comprehensive guide to working with JSON in Python. It includes:

- Basics of JSON format.
- Converting Python objects to JSON (serialization) and JSON to Python objects (deserialization).
- Handling complex data structures with JSON.

Key Functions:
- `json.dumps()`: Converts a Python object to a JSON string.
- `json.loads()`: Parses a JSON string and returns a Python object.
- `json.dump()`: Serializes a Python object and writes it to a file.
- `json.load()`: Reads a JSON file and returns a Python object.

### 5. Python Data Serialization
**Source**: [Real Python](https://realpython.com/python-serialize-data/)

This article covers various methods for serializing data in Python, comparing JSON, pickle, and other serialization formats. It discusses:
- The advantages and disadvantages of different serialization methods.
- Use cases for JSON, pickle, and other serialization libraries like `marshal` and `h5py`.
- Best practices for choosing a serialization method based on the application requirements.

Key Takeaways:
- JSON is human-readable and widely used for web applications.
- Pickle is Python-specific and can serialize a wider range of Python objects but has security concerns.
- Other serialization formats might be more efficient for specific use cases (e.g., binary data).

## Summary

This collection of resources provides a comprehensive overview of various data serialization and parsing techniques in Python. From converting CSV to JSON, parsing XML with ElementTree, using the pickle module, to working with JSON, and comparing different serialization methods, these guides offer valuable insights and practical examples to enhance your data handling skills in Python.

## Tasks:

0. [Basic Serialization](./task_00_basic_serialization.py)

 * Create a basic serialization module that adds the functionality to serialize a Python dictionary to a JSON file and deserialize the JSON file to recreate the Python Dictionary.

1. [Pickling Custom Classes](./task_01_pickle.py)

 * Learn how to serialize and deserialize custom Python objects using the pickle module.

2. [Converting CSV Data to JSON Format](./task_02_csv.py)

 * The objective of this exercise is to gain experience in reading data from one format (CSV) and converting it into another format (JSON) using serialization techniques.

3. [Serializing and Deserializing with XML](./task_03_xml.py)

 * In this exercise we’ll explore serialization and deserialization using XML as an alternative format to JSON.

## Advanced:
