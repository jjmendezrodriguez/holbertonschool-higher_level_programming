# Python-Hello, World

## Authorâ€™s disclaimer

 Welcome to the Python world!

You'll soon find that with Python (and the majority of higher level languages), there are ten different ways to do the same thing. Some tasks will expect only one implementation, while other tasks will have multiple possible implementations.
Python has a linter / style guide, called PEP8, also now known as PyCode. At Holberton, we won't start off with using PyCode, because it's much more strict compared to PEP8. Don't worry if you see a warning when you are running PEP8, you can ignore it.

Enjoy!
